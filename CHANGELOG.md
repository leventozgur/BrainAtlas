# Changelog

## 0.1.0-rc.3 — 2026-11-08

- `init` now creates the vault skeleton (idempotent, never overwrites); `migrate` accepts a destination that only holds an untouched init skeleton.
- `--json` commands print exactly one JSON value on stdout; errors use `{"ok":false,"error":{…}}`; module logs go to stderr.
- Removed build artifacts accidentally committed under `release/dist/`.

## 0.1.0-rc.2 — 2026-11-08 (built and verified locally, not tagged: second-host sync failed because `init` did not create the vault)

- Added a self-contained release distribution folder and install kit (R-KIT).
- Added Git transport setup and sync operations (S-OPS), plus stable host identity configuration (S-HOSTID).
- Added Gemini CLI `BeforeAgent` and `SessionStart` hooks (A-GEMINI2).
- Hardened output redaction and health reporting (I-HARDEN).
- Added the MIT attribution for avenoxbeyin in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`.

## 0.1.0-rc.1 — 2026-11-08 (local release candidate; signed with a development key, not published)

- Added Lite and Full release profiles with signed archive verification and install/update/rollback support.
- Added local configuration, vault paths, doctor/status checks, and managed uninstall behavior.
- Added coding-agent adapters for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Kiro, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.
- Added MCP tools for Wiki retrieval, reading, status, lint, and controlled writes.
- Added bounded hooks, local secret filtering, path deny rules, and privacy-preserving hook metrics.
- Added OKF v0.2-inspired local metadata checks and optional strict module.
- Added optional Git and Dropbox synchronization modules; folder sync is experimental.
- Added optional semantic retrieval behind an evaluation gate; experimental and off by default.
- Added `migrate` (copy-based, source read-only), `adopt --plan` and `help`.
